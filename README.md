# D&D Trove
This website was a final project for a Web Design course. 

With this project I wanted to create a website that would work as some sort of "vault" for players and the characters they create. While the website is static at the current moment, I have plans to revisit this and build it bigger and better.

## Overview
Users should be able to:

- Navigate between pages through the navigation bar
- View optimal layout for the website based on device screen size
- See hover states for all intereactive elements on the page
- See animations as users scroll down the page
